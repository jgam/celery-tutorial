## What is celery?
It is a task queue and I am hoping to learn the following:
⋅⋅* choosing and installing a message transport(broker)
⋅⋅* installing Celery and creating first task
⋅⋅* starting the worker and claling tasks
⋅⋅* keeping track of tasks as they transition through different states, and inspecting return values

##choosing and installing a message transport?
I basically used default broker which is rabbitMQ.
